# Master's thesis

This code was developed in the course of my Master's in Conservation Biology at the University of Bern.   

It was applied to the case of the conservation introduction of the Sihek and resulted in the article titled "Assessing invasion risks using EICAT-based expert elicitation: application to a conservation translocation".  

This repo contains source files for this article and relevant data.
